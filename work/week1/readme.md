## # Week-1 Summary

> In this week, i was supposed to learn how [micro-mordred](https://github.com/chaoss/grimoirelab-sirmordred#micro-mordred) works, open an issue ticket explaining the same and eventually open a Pull request to the [chaoss/grimoirelab-tutorial](https://github.com/chaoss/grimoirelab-tutorial) in order to add a tutorial on how to execute micro-mordred via docker-compose.

- I'd opened an issue ticket ([chaoss/grimoirelab-tutorial#84](https://github.com/chaoss/grimoirelab-tutorial/issues/84): [components] How to play with Grimoirelab components) for discussion in case i'm stuck somewhere. In the issue ticket, i'd addressed some issues that i faced and a probable solution to the problem (if faced in future).
- I went ahead to open a PR [chaoss/grimoirelab-tutorial#87](https://github.com/chaoss/grimoirelab-tutorial/pull/87): [micro-mordred] Add tutorial for execution of Micro-Mordred via Docker-Compose.
- I also proposed an addition for Graal tutorial to the sidebar [chaoss/grimoirelab-tutorial#86](https://github.com/chaoss/grimoirelab-tutorial/pull/86): [graal] Add Graal to the Sidebar .
- I also had a PR ( [chaoss/grimoirelab-graal#29](https://github.com/chaoss/grimoirelab-graal/pull/29): [colic] Add support of scancode_cli to colic backend ) which was staged during the community bonding period. In this week, i got some reviews from my mentor [@valeriocos](https://github.com/valeriocos) and eventually got it merged  ðŸŽ‰
