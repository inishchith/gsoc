## # Week-5 Summary

> - For this week, we'd planned to get ready with the first iteration of the dashboard for a set of visualizations of metrics produced with the help of Graalâ€™s CoCom backend.
> - Adding more visualizations for metrics such as the relation between LOC and CCN, LOC and functions, and others.

- I started the week by getting repository-level implementation [graal-PR#29](https://github.com/chaoss/grimoirelab-graal/pull/39) reviewed by [@valcos](https://github.com/valeriocos) and completing changes proposed such as adding commit-level information to it. (we finally got it merged yesterday ðŸŽ‰)

- I had earlier done some work on data-tables to showcase attributes such as Overall CCN, LOC, and top-complex-files of a given repository, I went on to create an [issue ticket](https://github.com/inishchith/gsoc-graal/issues/11#issuecomment-505134143) in order to keep track of ideas and to conduct discussion on the same. <br> Some of the implemented widgets are shown below -

<div align="center">
       <b>[ Pie: Top complex files for given projects ]</b>
</div>

> This week's task also included analyzing data produced by Graal's CoLic(Code License) backend, I've opened an [issue ticket](https://github.com/inishchith/gsoc-graal/issues/9) for the purpose of discussing relevant attributes to be added as fields in the enriched index of ElasticSearch and pushed some reference code on my fork of [grimoirelab-elk](https://github.com/inishchith/grimoirelab-elk/tree/gsoc-graal-2019-colic) with the help of earlier work done on CoCom enricher. The approach and further steps related to CoLic data(fields) and refinements to CoCom dashboard will be discussed in today's meeting.
